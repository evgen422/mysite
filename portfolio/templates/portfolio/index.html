        <!-- Add more skills here -->
        1. Web scraping and data parsing: Mention that you have experience in scraping and parsing data from a popular eCommerce site. You can specify the tools and libraries you used, such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup, to accomplish this task.

2. Web development: Emphasize that you built a copy of the eCommerce site using Django, a popular web framework in Python. Highlight your ability to create dynamic web pages and handle user interactions.

3. Database management: Mention that you utilized MySQL to store the scraped data. Highlight your proficiency in working with databases, including creating tables, inserting data, and querying information.

For your second project, you can describe your skills as follows:

1. Computer vision: Highlight your experience in computer vision by mentioning that you worked with OpenCV, a powerful library for image and video processing. Specify that you used it to capture frames from a webcam.

2. Object detection: Emphasize that you implemented object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a popular deep learning algorithm. Mention that you used it to detect cars in the captured frames.

3. Object tracking: Highlight your ability to track the detected cars using Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking), a tracking algorithm. Mention that you successfully tracked the cars across multiple frames.

4. Data storage and visualization: Mention that you saved the tracked car data to MySQL, showcasing your skills in database management. Additionally, highlight that you used Matplotlib, a data visualization library, to create graphs of road traffic based on the collected data.

1. Machine learning: Emphasize your experience in machine learning by mentioning that you trained neural networks to recognize handwritten letters and digits. Highlight your understanding of the underlying concepts and algorithms used in training and inference.

2. Image classification: Specify that you worked with the MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. Mention that you successfully trained neural networks to classify handwritten letters and digits based on the provided images.

3. Deep learning frameworks: Highlight the deep learning frameworks you used to train the neural networks. For example, if you used TensorFlow or PyTorch, mention your proficiency in working with these frameworks and their associated libraries.

4. Model evaluation and accuracy: Mention that you evaluated the performance of your trained models by measuring their accuracy on the MNIST dataset. Highlight any techniques or metrics you used to assess the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

5. User interaction: Describe how you implemented a user interface where users can draw a letter or digit, and your program can recognize and return the corresponding character. Highlight your ability to integrate the trained model into a user-friendly application.

6. Personal project: Mention that you pursued this project as a hobby, showcasing your passion for machine learning and your willingness to explore and apply your skills outside of formal settings.

Remember to provide specific examples and details about your project, such as the architecture of the neural networks, the training process, and any challenges you encountered and overcame. This will help demonstrate your expertise and showcase your ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
